## üåü Overview

Loan default prediction is a critical application of machine learning in the financial sector. This project leverages historical loan data to build predictive models that estimate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. By using this solution, financial institutions can reduce risks and improve decision-making in loan approvals.

This project predicts whether a customer will default on a loan using both logistic regression and random forest models. It consists of four main scripts:

1. log_reg.py: Trains the logistic regression model and saves it to a file.

2. random_forest.py: Trains the random forest model and saves to a file.

3. test.py: Tests the trained model on a dataset with targets to evaluate its performance.

4. inference.py: Takes user input via the command-line interface (CLI) to predict whether a customer will default on a loan.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `imblearn`, `joblib`, `argparse`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn joblib argparse
```

## Cloning the repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UncleTeslim/Zindi-Africa-Loan-Default-Prediction.git
cd loan-default-prediction
```

## Running the scripts
Running the Scripts:

### 1.Training the Model

The log_reg.py and random_forest.py scripts train the logistic regression and random forest model respectively using a training dataset and saves the trained model to a file (model.pkl).

Usage:
```bash
python log_reg.py train.csv
```
**OR**
```bash
python random_forest.py train.csv
```

train.csv: Path to the training dataset in CSV format.

This will:

1. Preprocess the data.

2. Train the logistic regression model.

3. Save the trained model to model.pkl.

4. Save the column names to columns.pkl for inference.
   


### 2.Training the Model
The test.py script tests the trained model on a dataset with targets and evaluates its performance using metrics like accuracy, classification report, and ROC AUC score.

Usage:
```bash
python test.py test.csv
```
test.csv: Path to the test dataset in CSV format.

This will:

1. Load the trained model from model.pkl.

2. Preprocess the test data.

3. Evaluate the model and print performance metrics.


### 3. Making predictions
The inference.py script takes user input via the CLI to predict whether a customer will default on a loan..

Usage:
```bash
python inference.py
```

This will prompt you to enter the following features:

Total_Amount: Total loan amount.

duration: Loan duration.

New_versus_Repeat: Whether the loan is new or repeat .

loan_type: Type of loan (encoded as an integer).

repayment_ratio: Ratio of total amount to repay to the total loan amount.

lender_funded_ratio: Ratio of the amount funded by the lender to the total loan amount.

lender_repaid_ratio: Ratio of the lender portion to be repaid to the lender portion funded.

The script will output the prediction (0 for no default, 1 for default).

***Please check VariableDefinitions.txt for inputs expected***

## üóÇ Dataset

The dataset for this project contains the following:
- **Features:** Loan amount, disbursement date, amoount repaid, New or returning borrower, duration etc.
- **Target Variable:** Binary (1 = Default, 0 = No Default).

> **Note:** The dataset was provided by [Zindi Africa](https://zindi.africa/](https://zindi.africa/competitions/african-credit-scoring-challenge) as part of the Loan Default Prediction Challenge. Access the dataset directly from the Zindi platform.

## üõ†Ô∏è Modeling Approach

1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handled missing values using imputation.
   - Dealt with outliers to reduce model bias.
2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created meaningful features (e.g., repayment ratio).
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
3. **Machine Learning Algorithms:**  
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier 
4. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Area Under Curve (AUC).  
   - Confusion Matrix.  
   - F1 Score for imbalanced data.
