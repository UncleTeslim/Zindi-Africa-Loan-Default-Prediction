## üåü Overview

Loan default prediction is a critical application of machine learning in the financial sector. This project leverages historical loan data to build predictive models that estimate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. 

By using this solution, financial institutions can reduce risks and improve decision-making in loan approvals.

## üõ†Ô∏è Modeling Approach

1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handled missing values using imputation.
   - Dealt with outliers to reduce model bias.
2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created meaningful features (e.g., repayment ratio).
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
3. **Machine Learning Algorithms:**  
   - Logistic Regression  
4. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Area Under Curve (AUC).  
   - Confusion Matrix.  
   - F1 Score for imbalanced data.
